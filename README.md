# Florida-Energy-Website-Redesign

## Week 7: Assignment: Google Charts

Add two charts to redesign project, using provided data below. One chart shows annual renewable energy production in Florida, and the other shows annual total electricity consumption in Florida. These charts can be added to an existing page in your site where they would make sense, or you can add a new page (/data maybe?) to hold the charts. If you add an additional page, it of course should share basic design with the rest of the site, e.g. header, nav, footer.

Select the chart type you feel best suits data. Use at least 3 configuration options to customize charts' appearances.

Add a note to the project's README file linking to the charting library used, and explaining why you chose the chart types you did. 

### Annual Renewable Energy Production

### Methodology:

I chose to use a line chart for both data sets provided. The main reason for this was due to the fact that there was a large number of data points in both sets. It would be unrealistic to use a bar chart in this scenario because it would make the page look clunky. 

Also, the data sets provided allows the user to see trends of energy consumption and production over a span of years.
